# PROJECT
---------

* Piggy Bank
------------
	You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these 
	three countries.

	Write a C++ program called currency.cpp that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency. Your prompts should look like:

		Enter number of Colombian Pesos:
		Enter number of Brazilian Reais:
		Enter number of Peruvian Soles:

	Your program should then convert the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

		US Dollars = $______

	Creating variables:
	-------------------
	1.
	First things first, let’s declare three variables:

		. pesos for Pesos
		. reais for Reais
		. soles for Soles

	Hint
	You can do it using three different lines:

		double pesos;
		double reais;
		double soles;

	Or you can do it together:

		double pesos, reais, soles;

	2.
	You’ll need another variable to store the amount you have in dollars.

	Let’s declare a variable called dollars.


	Hint
		double dollars;

	3.
	Compile and execute the code to make sure it’s bug-free before moving on!


	Hint
	Compile:

		g++ currency.cpp

	Execute:

		./a.out
	
	Asking the questions and taking inputs:
	---------------------------------------
	4.
	You’ll want to ask the user the first question:

		Enter number of Colombian Pesos:

	Hint
	std::cout << "Enter number of Colombian Pesos: ";

	5.
	You then want the user to type in how much they have and store it in pesos.


	Hint
		std::cin >> pesos;

	6.
	Do this for the other two currencies.


	Hint
		std::cout << "Enter number of Colombian Pesos: ";
		std::cin >> pesos;
 
		std::cout << "Enter number of Brazilian Reais: ";
		std::cin >> reais;
 
		std::cout << "Enter number of Peruvian Soles: ";
		std::cin >> soles;

	Coverting to USD:

	7.
	Google the conversion rates:

		from Pesos to USD
		from Reais to USD
		from Soles to USD

	And write them down in your code using a comment.


	Hint
	As of Feb. 27th, 2019:

		// Pesos conversion rate: 0.00032
		// Reais conversion rate: 0.27
		// Soles conversion rate: 0.3

	8.
	Write an equation that solves for the total USD.

	This will look something like:

	dollars = (conversion_rate1 * currency1) + (conversion_rate2 * currency2) + (conversion_rate3 * currency3)

	Hint
	For example:

		dollars = 0.00032 * pesos + 0.27 * reais + 0.3 * soles;

	9.
	Display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

	US Dollars = $______

	Hint
		std::cout << "Total USD = $" << dollars << "\n";

	Given 4 pesos, 5 soles, and 6 reais, you should have $3.12128 USD.

	Optional:
	10.

		Sample solution(s):

	currency.cpp
	P.S. If you make something cool, share it with us!
