# PROJECT - DOG YEARS
---------------------

* Dog Years
-----------
	"How old is your fuzzy friend in human years?"

	Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. If you own a dog, you might’ve heard this rule: one year for Snoopy equals seven years for you. Turns out, the math isn’t that 
	simple. Dogs mature more quickly than we do early on.

	Here’s how we can convert your dog’s age into human years:

		. The first two years of a dog’s life count as 21 human years.

		. Each following year counts as 4 human years.

	So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human years… hmm this is about to get more complicated. Before you start doing 
	the math in your head, let a computer take care of it!

	Write a C++ program called dog_years.cpp to calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than 2.

	Creating the variables that we need:
	------------------------------------
	1.
	Declare an int variable named dog_age, and set it equal to your dog’s age as a number.

	Write a comment that explains this line of code.

	Note: This version of the program is for dogs older than 2 years old.


	Hint
	If you don’t have a dog, you can use the number 6.

	Your code should look something like:

		// Sparkles is 6 years old
		int dog_age = 6;

	// is how you can write a comment.

	2.
	Let’s declare three more int variables:

		. early_years: for your dog’s first two years
	
		. later_years: for your dog’s following years

		. human_years: for your dog’s total human years

	Hint
	You can do this on one line:

		int early_years, later_years, human_years;

	Or on three separate lines:

		int early_years;
		int later_years;
		int human_years;

	Solving for the human years:
	----------------------------
	3.
	“The first two years of a dog’s life count as 21 human years.”

	Let’s give the variable early_years a value of 21.

	Write a comment that explains this line of code.


	Hint
	It should look something like:

		// The first two years
		early_years = 21;

	4.
	“Each following year counts as 4 human years.”

	So the equation looks something like:

		later_years=(dog_age−2)∗4

	Give the variable later_years a value of dog_age minus 2, and then multiply by 4.

	Write a comment that explains this line of code.


	Hint
	// The following years
	later_years = (dog_age - 2) * 4;

	Remember, the order of operation matters in arthmetic.

	You can use parentheses to group operations together to follow PEMDAS, which is an acronym for:

		. Parenthesis

		. Exponents

		. Multiplication

		. Division

		. Addition

		. Subtraction

	5.
	Add early_years and later_years together, and store that in a variable named human_years.

	Write a comment that explains this line of code.


	Hint
		// Your dog's age in human years
		human_years = early_years + later_years;

	6.
	Write a std::cout statement that displays your dog’s name and age in human years.

	Use chaining to display the value in the following sentence:

		My name is ____! Ruff ruff, I am [AGE] years old in human years.

	You can fill in the blank with your dog’s name and [AGE] with the value of human_years in the sentence above.


	Hint
	std::cout << "My name is Sparkles! Ruff ruff, I am " << human_years << " years old in human years.\n";

	7.
	Compile and execute the code to make sure it’s bug-free!


	Hint
	Compile:

		g++ dog_years.cpp

	Execute:

		./a.out

	Optional:
	---------
	8.
	Great work! You just converted a dog’s age to human years. Try changing dog_age and see what happens.

	And now you might be wondering, how can you make this program work for puppies, too?

	Well, you need to use something called a conditional to determine if the dog is younger than 2 and do something different if that’s true. This is covered in the next lesson!

	Sample solutions:

		. dog_years1.cpp
		. dog_years2.cpp

	P.S. If you make something cool, share it with us!


	Hint
	All you need to do is change the value of dog_age and run again.
